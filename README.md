Question 1:

We would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature. There would be a lot of functions used when sending a message to another user, such as connecting to the network, encrypting the message, recieving the message, and taking in user input. 

Question 2:

We would use a unit test to test the "max message length" function. The function should be relatively simple, only concerned with the length of the message. A unit test would allow us to test this part of the code quickly.
